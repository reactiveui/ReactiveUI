ReactiveUI has a large community that can help you out if you have questions. If you can't find your answer in the documentation, you can `Ask your question on StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactiveui>`_. Be sure to use the ``ReactiveUI`` tag in your question.

Commercial Support
==================

No companies currently offer commercial support for Autofac questions/design issues but if you would like your company listed here, please send an email to the project maintainer.
