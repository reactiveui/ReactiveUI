is it still impossible to use RXUI binding inside ItemTemplate?

paulcbetts [5:35 AM] 
Yes

ionoy [5:35 AM] 
damn

paulcbetts [5:35 AM] 
Well, inside an implicit DataTemplate

paulcbetts [5:36 AM]
You have to create a UserControl

paulcbetts [5:36 AM]
The good news is, if you use `OneWayBind` to set the ItemsSource, we'll set up a DataTemplate for you

ionoy [5:37 AM] 
can you elaborate? if I have an Items collection and one way bind it to my list, how should I name this UserControl then? (for you to automatically set it as DataTemplate) (edited)

paulcbetts [5:38 AM] 
You can name it whatever you want, as long as:
1. The UserControl implements `IViewFor<TheViewModelYourePuttingIntoThatList>`
2. You register the View: `Locator.CurrentMutable.Register(() => new MyUserControl, typeof(IViewFor< TheViewModelYourePuttingIntoThatList>));`

ionoy [5:38 AM] 
oh, awesome

paulcbetts [5:39 AM] 
The end result is, in ReactiveUI you end up writing a bit more UserControls, but your XAML is cleaner

ionoy [5:39 AM] 
this is actually a very good solution

paulcbetts [5:39 AM] 
Because your ListBox can now be as simple as `<ListBox x:Name="MyList" />`

ionoy [5:39 AM] 
yep

ionoy [5:49 AM] 
hm, one downside is that my design time data isn't displayed nicely anymore...

paulcbetts [5:59 AM] 
Design time data is the best part of ReactiveUI

paulcbetts [5:59 AM]
So, the way you do design time data, is that you just *set the property* to whatever you want

paulcbetts [5:59 AM]
And at runtime, the RxUI binding will override it

paulcbetts [6:00 AM]
It works with ItemsControls too

paulcbetts [6:01 AM]
```<ListBox x:Name="Foo">
<ListBox.Items>   <!-- At runtime, ItemsSource trumps Items -->
<MyControl />
<MyControl />
<MyControl />
</ListBox.Items>
</ListBox>


moswald [6:14 AM] 
the only downside is that if you are setting your `ItemsSource` from within a call to `WhenActivated` , your design-time data ends up showing up for a frame or two

moswald [6:14 AM]
the solution is to manually clear your design-time data at the bottom of your constructor in those cases

ionoy [6:56 AM] 
@moswald: I set design time data via '{Binding Source={d:DesignInstance Type=models:DesignTimeData, IsDesignTimeCreatable=True}}', so it doesn't show when app is started
