##Version 1.4.0
(2014-12-11)
 
 This release provides a number of new features, but is mainly focused on bug
 fixes and improvements to platform stability and security.

 For a complete list of patches, fixes, and other improvements, see the [merge PR on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9345).
  
  *New Features*

  * You can now add labels to the Docker daemon using key=value pairs defined with
  the new `--label` flag. The labels are displayed by running `docker info`. In
  addition, `docker info` also now returns an ID and hostname field. For more
  information, see  the 
  [command line reference](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#daemon).
  * The `ENV` instruction in the `Dockerfile` now supports arguments in the form 
  of `ENV name=value name2=value2..`. For more information, see the 
  [command line reference](http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#env)
  * Introducing a new, still 
  [experimental, overlayfs storage driver](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/7619/).
  * You can now add filters to `docker events` to filter events by event name, 
  container, or image. For more information, see  the 
  [command line reference](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#events).
  * The `docker cp` command now supports copying files from the filesystem of a
  container's volumes. For more information, see  the 
  [remote API reference](http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/).
  * The `docker tag` command has been fixed so that it correctly honors `--force`
  when overriding a tag for existing image. For more information, see 
  the [command line reference](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#tag).

  * Container volumes are now initialized during `docker create`. For more information, see 
  the [command line reference](http://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#create). 

  *Security Fixes*

  Patches and changes were made to address the following vulnerabilities:

  * CVE-2014-9356: Path traversal during processing of absolute symlinks. 
  Absolute symlinks were not adequately checked for  traversal which created a
  vulnerability via image extraction and/or volume mounts.
  * CVE-2014-9357: Escalation of privileges during decompression of LZMA (.xz)
  archives. Docker 1.3.2 added `chroot` for archive extraction. This created a
  vulnerability that could allow malicious images or builds to write files to the
  host system and escape containerization, leading to privilege escalation.
  * CVE-2014-9358: Path traversal and spoofing opportunities via image
  identifiers. Image IDs passed either via `docker load` or registry communications
  were not sufficiently validated. This created a vulnerability to path traversal
  attacks wherein malicious images or repository spoofing could lead to graph
  corruption and manipulation.

  > **Note:** the above CVEs are also patched in Docker 1.3.3, which was released
  > concurrently with 1.4.0.

  *Runtime fixes*

  * Fixed an issue that caused image archives to be read slowly.

  *Client fixes*
   
   * Fixed a regression related to STDIN redirection.
   * Fixed a regression involving `docker cp` when the current directory is the
   destination.
