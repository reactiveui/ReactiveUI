# Events

That reactiveui-*-events packages have no adherence to ReactiveUI per-se, you can do RxUI without them, and you can use them without RxUI. They're simply "generated extension methods for every type exposing .Net events to expose corresponding IObservable wrappers", to save you the burden of writing the FromEvent/FromEventPattern yourself.

The events packages are generated by a Moustache template https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI.Events/Events.mustache and console app + ruby script @ https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI.Events/generate_events.rb
