  <h1>ReactiveUI</h1>
  <p>
    ReactiveUI is a composable, cross-platform model-view-viewmodel framework for all .NET platforms that is inspired by functional reactive programming which is a paradigm that allows you to abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and express the idea around a feature in one readable place and improve the testability of your application.

<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

Long ago, when computer programming first came to be, machines had to be programmed quite manually. If the technician entered the correct sequence of machine codes in the correct order, then the resulting program behavior would satisfy the business requirements. Instead of telling a computer how to do its job, which error-prone and relies too heavily on the infallibility of the programmer, why don't we just tell it what it's job is and let it figure the rest out?

ReactiveUI is inspired by the paradigm of Functional Reactive Programming, which allows you to model user input as a function that changes over time. This is super cool because it allows you to abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and express the idea around a feature in one readable place whilst improving application testability. Reactive programming can look scary and complex at first glance, but the best way to describe reactive programming is to think of a spreadsheet:

![](https://reactiveui.net/images/frp-excel.gif)


* Three cells, A, B, and C.
* C is defined as the sum of A and B.
* Whenever A or B changes, C reacts to update itself.

That's reactive programming: changes propagate throughout a system automatically. Welcome to the peanut butter and jelly of programming paradigms. For further information please watch the this video from the Xamarin Evolve conference - [Why You Should Be Building Better Mobile Apps with Reactive Programming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYEbUF4xs1Q) by Michael Stonis.

<h2 align="center">A Compelling Example</h2>

Let‚Äôs say you have a text field, and whenever the user types something into it, you want to make a network request which searches for that query.


![](http://i.giphy.com/xTka02wR2HiFOFACoE.gif)

```csharp
public interface ISearchViewModel
{
    ReactiveList<SearchResults> SearchResults { get; }
    string SearchQuery { get; }	 
    ReactiveCommand<string, List<SearchResults>> Search { get; }
    ISearchService SearchService { get; }
}
```

<h3 align="center">Define under what conditions a network request will be made</h3>

```csharp
// Here we're describing here, in a *declarative way*, the conditions in
// which the Search command is enabled.  Now our Command IsEnabled is
// perfectly efficient, because we're only updating the UI in the scenario
// when it should change.
var canSearch = this.WhenAny(x => x.SearchQuery, x => !String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x.Value));
```

<h3 align="center">Make the network connection</h3>

```csharp
// ReactiveCommand has built-in support for background operations and
// guarantees that this block will only run exactly once at a time, and
// that the CanExecute will auto-disable and that property IsExecuting will
// be set accordingly whilst it is running.
Search = ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask<string, List<SearchResults>>(_ => 
        searchService.Search(this.SearchQuery), canSearch);
```

<h3 align="center">Update the user interface</h3>

```csharp
// ReactiveCommands are themselves IObservables, whose value are the results
// from the async method, guaranteed to arrive on the UI thread. We're going
// to take the list of search results that the background operation loaded, 
// and them into our SearchResults.
Search.Subscribe(results => {
    SearchResults.Clear();
    SearchResults.AddRange(results);
});

```

<h3 align="center">Handling failures</h3>

```csharp
// ThrownExceptions is any exception thrown from the CreateAsyncTask piped
// to this Observable. Subscribing to this allows you to handle errors on
// the UI thread. 
Search.ThrownExceptions
    .Subscribe(ex => {
        UserError.Throw("Potential Network Connectivity Error", ex);
    });
```

<h3 align="center">Throttling network requests and automatic search execution behaviour</h3>

```csharp
// Whenever the Search query changes, we're going to wait for one second
// of "dead airtime", then automatically invoke the subscribe command.
this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SearchQuery)
    .Throttle(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), RxApp.MainThreadScheduler)
    .InvokeCommand(Search);
```
