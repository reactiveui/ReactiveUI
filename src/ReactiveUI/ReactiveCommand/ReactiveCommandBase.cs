/// <summary>
/// A base class for generic reactive commands.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class extends <see cref="ReactiveCommand"/> and adds generic type parameters for the parameter values passed
/// into command execution, and the return values of command execution.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Because the result type is known by this class, it can implement <see cref="IObservable{T}"/>. However, the implementation
/// is defined as abstract, so subclasses must provide it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Reactive commands encapsulate the behavior of running some execution logic and then surfacing the results on the UI
/// thread. Importantly, no scheduling is performed against input observables (the <c>canExecute</c> and execution pipelines).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// To create an instance of <c>ReactiveCommand</c>, call one of the static creation methods defined by this class.
/// <see cref="ReactiveCommand.Create"/> can be used when your execution logic is synchronous.
/// ReactiveCommand.CreateFromObservable and
/// ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask (and overloads) can be used for asynchronous
/// execution logic. Optionally, you can provide an observable that governs the availability of the command for execution,
/// as well as a scheduler to which events will be delivered.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The <see cref="CanExecute"/> property provides an observable that can be used to determine whether the command is
/// eligible for execution. The value of this observable is determined by both the <c>canExecute</c> observable provided
/// during command creation, and the current execution status of the command. A command that is already executing will
/// yield <c>false</c> from its <see cref="CanExecute"/> observable regardless of the <c>canExecute</c> observable provided
/// during command creation.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The <see cref="IsExecuting"/> property provides an observable whose value indicates whether the command is currently
/// executing. This can be a useful means of triggering UI, such as displaying an activity indicator whilst a command is
/// executing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// As discussed above, you are under no obligation to somehow incorporate this into your <c>canExecute</c> observable
/// because that is taken care of for you. That is, if the value of <c>IsExecuting</c> is <c>true</c>, the value of
/// <c>CanExecute</c> will be <c>false</c>. However, if the value of <c>CanExecute</c> is <c>false</c>, that does not imply
/// the value of <c>IsExecuting</c> is <c>true</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Any errors in your command's execution logic (including any <c>canExecute</c> observable you choose to provide) will be
/// surfaced via the <see cref="ThrownExceptions"/> observable. This gives you the opportunity to handle the error before
/// it triggers a default handler that tears down the application. For example, you might use this as a means of alerting
/// the user that something has gone wrong executing the command.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For the sake of convenience, all <c>ReactiveCommand</c> instances are also implementations of <see cref="ICommand"/>.
/// This allows you to easily integrate instances of <c>ReactiveCommand</c> into platforms that understands <c>ICommand</c>
/// natively (such as WPF and UWP).
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
/// <typeparam name="TParam">
/// The type of parameter values passed in during command execution.
