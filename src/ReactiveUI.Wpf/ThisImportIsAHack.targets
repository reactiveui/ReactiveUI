  We are doing this because of https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/1504
  When the new csproj format and visual studio settle down the path to resolve
  this is to delete ReactiveUI.WPF.csproj and convert it over to using the
  new CSPROJ format. We originally did this when doing the netstandard migration
  but had to back this out because we couldn't identify a way to ship
  XAML themes: https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/pull/1427
