            This parameter indicates the relative or absolute file system path of the
            folder that will contain the checkpoint file for the instance. The path
            must be terminated with a backslash character, which indicates that the

            This parameter sets the three letter prefix used for many of the files used by
            the database engine. For example, the checkpoint file is called EDB.CHK by
            default because EDB is the default base name.

            This parameter supplies an application specific string that will be added to
            any event log messages that are emitted by the database engine. This allows
            easy correlation of event log messages with the source application. By default
            the host application executable name will be used.

            This parameter reserves the requested number of cursor resources for use by an
            instance. A cursor resource directly corresponds to a JET_TABLEID data type.
            This setting will affect how many cursors can be used at the same time. A cursor
            resource cannot be shared by different sessions so this parameter must be set to
            a large enough value so that each session can use as many cursors as are required.

            <summary>
            This parameter reserves the requested number of temporary table resources for use
            by an instance. This setting will affect how many temporary tables can be used at
            the same time. If this system parameter is set to zero then no temporary database
            will be created and any activity that requires use of the temporary database will
            fail. This setting can be useful to avoid the I/O required to create the temporary
            database if it is known that it will not be used.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The use of a temporary table also requires a cursor resource.

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.LogFileSize">
            <summary>
            This parameter will configure the size of the transaction log files. Each
            transaction log file is a fixed size. The size is equal to the setting of
            this system parameter in units of 1024 bytes.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.LogBuffers">
            <summary>
            This parameter will configure the amount of memory used to cache log records
            before they are written to the transaction log file. The unit for this
            parameter is the sector size of the volume that holds the transaction log files.
            The sector size is almost always 512 bytes, so it is safe to assume that size
            for the unit. This parameter has an impact on performance. When the database
            engine is under heavy update load, this buffer can become full very rapidly.
            A larger cache size for the transaction log file is critical for good update
            performance under such a high load condition. The default is known to be too small
            for this case.
            Do not set this parameter to a number of buffers that is larger (in bytes) than
            half the size of a transaction log file.

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.CircularLog">
            <summary>
            This parameter configures how transaction log files are managed by the database
            engine. When circular logging is off, all transaction log files that are generated
            are retained on disk until they are no longer needed because a full backup of the
            database has been performed. When circular logging is on, only transaction log files
            that are younger than the current checkpoint are retained on disk. The benefit of
            this mode is that backups are not required to retire old transaction log files.

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.DbExtensionSize">
            <summary>
            This parameter controls the amount of space that is added to a database file each
            time it needs to grow to accommodate more data. The size is in database pages.

        </member>
        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.PageTempDBMin">
            <summary>
            This parameter controls the initial size of the temporary database. The size is in
            database pages. A size of zero indicates that the default size of an ordinary
            database should be used. It is often desirable for small applications to configure
            the temporary database to be as small as possible. Setting this parameter to
            SystemParameters.PageTempDBSmallest will achieve the smallest temporary database possible.
            </summary>

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.CacheSizeMax">
            <summary>
            This parameter configures the maximum size of the database page cache. The size
            is in database pages. If this parameter is left to its default value, then the
            maximum size of the cache will be set to the size of physical memory when JetInit
            is called.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.CheckpointDepthMax">
            <summary>
            This parameter controls how aggressively database pages are flushed from the
            database page cache to minimize the amount of time it will take to recover from a
            crash. The parameter is a threshold in bytes for about how many transaction log
            files will need to be replayed after a crash. If circular logging is enabled using
            JET_param.CircularLog then this parameter will also control the approximate amount
            of transaction log files that will be retained on disk.

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.StartFlushThreshold">
            <summary>
            This parameter controls when the database page cache begins evicting pages from the
            cache to make room for pages that are not cached. When the number of page buffers in the cache
            drops below this threshold then a background process will be started to replenish that pool
            of available buffers. This threshold is always relative to the maximum cache size as set by
            JET_paramCacheSizeMax. This threshold must also always be less than the stop threshold as
            set by JET_paramStopFlushThreshold.
            <para>
            The distance height of the start threshold will determine the response time that the database
             page cache must have to produce available buffers before the application needs them. A high
            start threshold will give the background process more time to react. However, a high start
            threshold implies a higher stop threshold and that will reduce the effective size of the
            database page cache for modified pages (Windows 2000) or for all pages (Windows XP and later).

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.StopFlushThreshold">
            <summary>
            This parameter controls when the database page cache ends evicting pages from the cache to make
            room for pages that are not cached. When the number of page buffers in the cache rises above
            this threshold then the background process that was started to replenish that pool of available
            buffers is stopped. This threshold is always relative to the maximum cache size as set by
            JET_paramCacheSizeMax. This threshold must also always be greater than the start threshold
            as set by JET_paramStartFlushThreshold.
            <para>
            The distance between the start threshold and the stop threshold affects the efficiency with
            which database pages are flushed by the background process. A larger gap will make it
            more likely that writes to neighboring pages may be combined. However, a high stop
            threshold will reduce the effective size of the database page cache for modified
            pages (Windows 2000) or for all pages (Windows XP and later).

            <summary>
            This parameter is the master switch that controls crash recovery for an instance.
            If this parameter is set to "On" then ARIES style recovery will be used to bring all
            databases in the instance to a consistent state in the event of a process or machine
            crash. If this parameter is set to "Off" then all databases in the instance will be
            managed without the benefit of crash recovery. That is to say, that if the instance
            is not shut down cleanly using JetTerm prior to the process exiting or machine shutdown
            then the contents of all databases in that instance will be corrupted.

        <member name="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_param.CacheSize">
            <summary>
            This parameter can be used to control the size of the database page cache at run time.
            Ordinarily, the cache will automatically tune its size as a function of database and
            machine activity levels. If the application sets this parameter to zero, then the cache
            will tune its own size in this manner. However, if the application sets this parameter
            to a non-zero value then the cache will adjust itself to that target size.

            <summary>
            When this parameter is true, every database is checked at JetAttachDatabase time for
            indexes over Unicode key columns that were built using an older version of the NLS
            library in the operating system. This must be done because the database engine persists
            the sort keys generated by LCMapStringW and the value of these sort keys change from release to release.
            If a primary index is detected to be in this state then JetAttachDatabase will always fail with
            JET_err.PrimaryIndexCorrupted.
            If any secondary indexes are detected to be in this state then there are two possible outcomes.
            If AttachDatabaseGrbit.DeleteCorruptIndexes was passed to JetAttachDatabase then these indexes
            will be deleted and JET_wrnCorruptIndexDeleted will be returned from JetAttachDatabase. These
            indexes will need to be recreated by your application. If AttachDatabaseGrbit.DeleteCorruptIndexes
            was not passed to JetAttachDatabase then the call will fail with JET_errSecondaryIndexCorrupted.

            the discretionary use of version pages by the database engine. If the size of the version store exceeds

            This parameter configures the page size for the database. The page
            size is the smallest unit of space allocation possible for a database
            file. The database page size is also very important because it sets

            the instance after the tables they represent have been closed by
            the application. Large values for this parameter will cause the

            <summary>
            Gets or sets the amount of memory used to cache log records
            before they are written to the transaction log file. The unit for this
            parameter is the sector size of the volume that holds the transaction log files.
            The sector size is almost always 512 bytes, so it is safe to assume that size
            for the unit. This parameter has an impact on performance. When the database
            engine is under heavy update load, this buffer can become full very rapidly.
            A larger cache size for the transaction log file is critical for good update
            performance under such a high load condition. The default is known to be too small
            for this case.
            Do not set this parameter to a number of buffers that is larger (in bytes) than
            half the size of a transaction log file.

            <summary>
            Gets or sets a value indicating whether circular logging is on.
            When circular logging is off, all transaction log files that are generated
            are retained on disk until they are no longer needed because a full backup of the
            database has been performed. When circular logging is on, only transaction log files
            that are younger than the current checkpoint are retained on disk. The benefit of
            this mode is that backups are not required to retire old transaction log files.

            Gets or sets a value indicating whether JetInit fails when the database
            engine is configured to start using transaction log files on disk
            that are of a different size than what is configured. Normally,
            <see cref="M:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.Api.JetInit(Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_INSTANCE@)"/> will successfully recover the databases
            but will fail with <see cref="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.JET_err.LogFileSizeMismatchDatabasesConsistent"/>
            to indicate that the log file size is misconfigured. However, when
            this parameter is set to true then the database engine will silently
            delete all the old log files, start a new set of transaction log files
            using the configured log file size. This parameter is useful when the
            application wishes to transparently change its transaction log file
            size yet still work transparently in upgrade and restore scenarios.

            Gets or sets the initial size of the temporary database. The size is in
            database pages. A size of zero indicates that the default size of an ordinary
            database should be used. It is often desirable for small applications to configure
            the temporary database to be as small as possible. Setting this parameter to
            <see cref="F:Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.SystemParameters.PageTempDBSmallest"/> will achieve the smallest

            Callback function for native code. We don't want to throw an exception through
            unmanaged ESENT because that will corrupt ESENT's internal state. Instead we
            catch all exceptions and return an error instead. We use a CER to make catching
            the exceptions as reliable as possible.

             If the table has an auto-increment column, then a new value is

            Removing the wrappers can lead to crashes. In this case we trust
            the client code to keep its callback alive until ESENT doesn't need it any
            more. Once the wrapped callback is garbage collected we allow the wrapper
            to be collected as well. If ESENT subsequently uses the callback there will
            be a crash.

            The reason this is hard to deal with is that the lifetime of a JET_CALLBACK

            the other hand, keeping the callback wrapper alive indefinitely would lead
