Here you will find our automated integration tests. They aren't wired up into CI/CD yet but soon will be. Do you want to help out with it? Ask.

# Credits
- Some code was borrowed from [Kent's most excellent book](https://reactiveui.net/book) to scaffold up the initial `LoginViewModel` that is shared across all platforms. Additionally we used his work as the basis for `WPF` the platform. All Kent's code is licensed under MIT.
