This repository’s canonical agent guidance has been consolidated into:

- `agent.md` in the root folder or relative path is `../agent.md` to this file.

GitHub Copilot (and other coding agents) should read and follow `agent.md` for build/test commands, repository architecture context, coding standards, and AOT requirements.

If there is any conflict between this file and `agent.md`, follow **agent.md**.
