# A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows the same rules used in gitignore files.
# The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the
# standard @username or @org/team-name format. You can also refer to a user by an
# email address that has been added to their GitHub account, for example user@example.com.
